# IP address tracker
- It's IP address tracker coding challenge from Frontend Mentor
- The chalange is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- Clicking on the map displays the coordinates of the point
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

This is all [done!](https://ipfindgeo.vercel.app/)
